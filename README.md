# Hello Universe! I'm Marcelo Martins!!

***I'm a full stack developer!***


## üöÄ About Me
My professional life began in 2014 to 2015 when I took my first Hardware course and took the initiative to put into practice my knowledge as an independent performing Hardware maintenance and DOS Configuration. In the present day and after, having taken several courses, workshops and having joined the Computer Science degree, I returned my career to Full-Stack Development.

I seek the best of myself every day and improve my potential every moment!
